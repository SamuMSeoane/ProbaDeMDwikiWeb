## The Rosetta stone

In 1799, a French soldier in Napoleon's North Africa expeditions discovered a piece of black basalt that was 115 cm long and 75 cm wide near the Egyptian port of Rosetta (nowadays Raŝïd).

The stone was part of a stela from the 2nd century BC, which bore a decree written in three different alphabets: hieroglyphic, demontic and Greek. The French Egyptiologist Jean-François Champollion compared the three versions and succeeded in unravelling an age-old mistery: thanks to the stone, he finally managed to uncover the enigmatic language of hieroglyphics.

The Rosetta stone is today kept in the British Museum and is one of the most beautiful and fascinating milestones in the universal history of translation.
